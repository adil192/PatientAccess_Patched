The level of access is configured per patient for each proxy user, as they may care for more than one patient and need different levels of access.

The first time you register the proxy user as a new online user, a PIN document will be issued to provide them with sign in credentials. They will be linked to the patient and have access to the services specified at the point of registration. Once they are a registered online user, if they are linked to a further patient, no further PIN document is issued or required. The next time they sign in with their existing credentials, their account will have automatically been updated to include the further patient(s). To select any account for the further management, just select appropriate account and click on “Switch” control."</string>
